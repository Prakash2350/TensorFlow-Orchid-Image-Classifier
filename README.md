# TensorFlow-Orchid-Image-Classifier
This project uses TensorFlow to build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that classifies images of orchid species found in the northeastern United States and Canada. The main goal of this project was to provide a user-friendly tool for identifying orchid species without the use of dichotomous keys and a familiarity with botanical jargon.
